# Automated-Image-Analysis-for-Ki67-Scoring-in-Gastroenteropancreatic-Neuroendocrine-Tumors

The ML and non-ML analysis created file containing the coordinate of detected cells. the same file exist from the manual count (ground truth). In here, read the number and cooridnate of total and positive tumor cells detected by both analysis tools and the one from the ground truth. Then do a distance calculation between the detected tumor cells by each analysis tools and the ground truth, to find the best match. The porpuse is to find the correct tumor cell detections. At the end generate a word file containing all the results.
